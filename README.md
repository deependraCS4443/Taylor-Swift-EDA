# Taylor Swift EDA 🎤

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Taylor Swift's discography, using Spotify API data and Tableau dashboards to uncover patterns in song attributes, popularity, and album evolution.

## 🎯 Objective
To explore trends across Taylor Swift's songs using audio features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, and popularity. The goal was to identify how her musical style has evolved across albums and what makes certain songs more popular than others.

## 📦 Dataset
- Pulled from Spotify API via Spotipy
- Includes audio features for over 150 tracks across multiple albums

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data processing
- **Pandas, NumPy** for wrangling and analysis
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** for static plots
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Spotipy** for Spotify API access

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize:
- Popularity trends by album
- Danceability vs. energy scatter plots
- Album evolution over time


## 📈 Key Insights
- Her earlier albums showed higher acousticness and lower energy
- Recent albums increased in danceability and electronic production
- Popularity correlates strongly with energy and valence

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to extract and analyze API-based music data
- Data storytelling through Tableau
- Combining Python with BI tools for effective presentation

## 📁 File Structure
- `TaylorSwiftEDA.ipynb`: Python analysis notebook
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned Spotify audio features
- `visuals/`: Plots and charts
- `Tableau/`: Packaged workbook or screenshots
