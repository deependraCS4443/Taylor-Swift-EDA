## ðŸ’¿ EDA on Taylor Swift's Spotify Albums

To effectively showcase your skills, sometimes it's beneficial to perform EDA on datasets that captivate a broad audience. The dataset provided comprises data extracted from Spotify's API, focusing on all albums by Taylor Swift as of November 2023.

### Dataset Columns Description:

- **name**: The name of the song.
- **album**: The name of the album.
- **release_date**: The day, month, and year the album was released.
- **track number**: The order the song appears on the album.
- **id**: The Spotify ID for the song.
- **uri**: The Spotify URI for the song.
- **acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
- **danceability**: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
- **energy**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 representing a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Values typically feel fast, loud, and noisy.
- **instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Values closer to 1.0 indicate a greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
- **liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. A value above 0.8 provides a strong likelihood that the track is live.
- **loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Values typically range between -60 and 0 dB.
- **speechiness**: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The attribute value can indicate tracks made entirely of spoken words or a mix of music and speech.
- **tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
- **valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
- **popularity**: The popularity of the song on a scale from 0 to 100.
- **duration_ms**: The duration of the track in milliseconds.


## Questions to Consider in Tableau Analysis:

These are just ideas to help get your started! Allow your own ideas to come to life as well!

1. **Song Insights**: Which Taylor Swift songs has the highest popularity score?
  
2. **Album Breakdown**: Can you visualize the distribution of song lengths (duration) across Taylor Swift's albums? Note: It may be helpful to create a calculated field to represent the duration in minutes rather than milliseconds.

3. **Temporal Trends**: How has the danceability of Taylor Swift's songs evolved over the years?

4. **Live Performance Insights**: Based on the liveness metric, which songs or albums are more likely to have been performed live?

5. **Loudness Trends**: Is there a trend in the loudness of Taylor Swift's songs over her albums? Are her newer songs generally louder than her earlier ones?

6. **Speech vs. Music**: Using the speechiness metric, can you identify songs that are more speech-like versus those that are purely musical?

7. **Temporal Patterns**: Are there particular years where Taylor Swift's songs have a distinct pattern in terms of tempo or valence?

> **Note**: Additionally, I have attached a lyrics CSV for those interested in incorporating lyrical data into their visual analyses. Feel free to explore this dataset (or even others that you find!) to enhance your insights.

The main goal is to put all these graphs and charts together into a clear dashboard and/or story to show your findings. Feel free to use images, colors, and other features to make your visuals stand out! We will have a Show & Tell to allow you the opportunity to showcase your work with the class. Good luck!! ðŸŽ¸
